        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around objects and classes. Here are the five key concepts of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**: This concept involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. Encapsulation hides the internal state of the object from the outside world and only exposes a controlled interface. This helps in protecting the integrity of the data and ensures that the object's internal workings can be changed without affecting other parts of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows a programmer to focus on interactions at a high level without needing to understand the intricate details of how those interactions are implemented. In practice, abstraction is often implemented through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**: This concept allows a new class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes. For example, a `Bird` class might be a subclass of an `Animal` class, inheriting general animal attributes while adding bird-specific features.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows a single function or method to work in different ways depending on the object it is acting upon. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method defined in its superclass) and method overloading (where multiple methods with the same name have different implementations based on their parameters).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Composition**: While not always listed with the core concepts, composition is an important concept in OOP. It refers to building complex objects from simpler ones by including instances of other classes as members. This allows for more flexible and modular design, where objects can be constructed by combining multiple components. For instance, a `Car` class might be composed of `Engine`, `Wheel`, and `Transmission` objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts work together to create a modular, reusable, and maintainable codebase, making OOP a powerful paradigm for software development.\n",

        "Method Resolution Order :\n",
        "Method Resolution Order(MRO) it denotes the way a programming language resolves a method or attribute. Python supports classes inheriting from other classes. The class being inherited is called the Parent or Superclass, while the class that inherits is called the Child or Subclass. In python, method resolution order defines the order in which the base classes are searched when executing a method. First, the method or attribute is searched within a class and then it follows the order we specified while inheriting. This order is also called Linearization of a class and set of rules are called MRO(Method Resolution Order). While inheriting from another class, the interpreter needs a way to resolve the methods that are being called via an instance."
